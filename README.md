Hello and welcome to my Github profile! 

As a former assistant manager of a poultry farm, I have always been drawn to problem-solving and optimization. Now, as a data analytics student at QUT, I am excited to apply those skills to the world of technology. My experience managing a complex operation has taught me the importance of attention to detail, risk management, and continuous improvement. These transferable skills, coupled with my technical proficiency in Python, R, and SQL queries, enable me to analyze complex data sets, detect patterns and anomalies, and identify potential security threats. I am passionate about using data analytics and cybersecurity to protect businesses and individuals from cyber attacks and enhance their performance. If you're looking for a proactive and adaptable team player with a strong work ethic and a passion for technology, I would be thrilled to connect with you.
